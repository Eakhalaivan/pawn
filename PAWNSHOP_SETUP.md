## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- Supabase account
- Project dependencies installed (`npm install`)

## 🚀 Database Setup

### Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
3. Click **New Query**

### Step 2: Run the Schema Script

1. Open the file: `supabase/pawnshop-schema.sql`
2. Copy the entire contents
3. Paste into the Supabase SQL Editor
4. Click **Run** or press `Ctrl+Enter`

This will create:
- ✅ All database tables (19 tables)
- ✅ Indexes for performance
- ✅ Row Level Security policies
- ✅ Auto-increment functions for pledge numbers and customer codes
- ✅ Sample master data (loan types, jewellery types, schemes, etc.)
- ✅ Default metal rates (Gold: ₹10,200/g, Silver: ₹300/g)

### Step 3: Verify Setup

Run this query to verify tables were created:

```sql
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN (
  'metal_rates', 'companies', 'loan_types', 'jewellery_types', 
  'schemes', 'bank_master', 'customers', 'pledges'
)
ORDER BY table_name;
```

You should see all 8+ tables listed.
